1. I put _root in Server data structure, but I think we should change how we handle data we already have instead of transferring into different structures
or instead of this:

Server::Server(int port, std::string ip, std::string root) {
    // TODO: closer to the end of the project we can define, if _port and _ip should be const
    std::cout << "Creating server with IP: " << ip << " and port: " << port << std::endl;
    _port = port;
    _ip = ip;
	_root = root;
    _socketFd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    if (_socketFd < 0) {
        std::cerr << "Error: Can not create socket" << std::endl;
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    std::cout << "Socket created successfully!" << std::endl;
}

maybe we should do something like this with initalization + more comprehensive to use through the whole process
Server(int port, const std::string& ip, const std::string& root) 
        : _port(port), _ip(ip), _root(root)

2. Should I do static functions for webcontent class?
