Tina: You can test our the website response, if you open another terminal and type: curl -i http://localhost:8002/
you should see this if it's okay, or 404,etc... if it's not okay OR you can check browser->devTools->Network, you reload there the page and it'll show you the status number

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1288
Connection: close


COMPARISON nginx with our webserver stept:
1 which nginx - test if installes
2 copy default one to test a site
sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/test_site
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/test_site
3 enable
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/test_site /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/


üß† Key Differences:
Feature			POST								  DELETE
Purpose			Add/upload data						  Delete a resource
Requires path?	Yes, path must exist				  Yes, file/resource must exist
Affects what?	Creates files/content			   	  Removes files/content
Creates path?	‚ùå No				  			 	‚ùå No
Requires body?	‚úÖ Usually (like a file or form) 	‚ùå No 


*test for evaluation*
curl -X POST localhost:8005/feedback "okay" *WRONG input*
curl -X POST -d "message=okay" localhost:8005/feedback *GOOD input*


*MAKE SURE .py executable*
chmod +x submit-feedback.py


File Type	Purpose
.txt	Simple, human-readable upload/download test.
.html	To serve static pages and verify content-type.


‚úÖ How to trigger your 403 check correctly
To trigger the Host mismatch check inside your server, you need to send a request to the server, but with an invalid Host header. Here's how:

Command																What it does									What you get
curl --resolve example.com:8005:127.0.0.1 http://example.com:8005/	Works 											‚úÖ	200 OK
curl --resolve example.com:8005:127.0.0.1 http://example.co:8005/	DNS fail 										‚ùå	curl error (not server)
curl -H "Host: wronghost.com" http://127.0.0.1:8005/				Connects to server, sends invalid Host header	403 Forbidden ‚úÖ

curl -X POST http://localhost:8005/ \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  --data "BODY IS HERE write something shorter or longer than body limit"

Yulia:
0. What parameters are mandatory in config?
1. (addition to previous) now if there is no location we put default. maybe we can just fail it? 
2. we need to check that no duplicated ip:port - on which side should we do it?
3. ClientMaxBodySize - I think we need to convert it to long or size_t or something? based on letter that we get (m, g, k, b)
4. I think bytes should be allowed in ClientMaxBodySize
5. 

Lucas notes:
if no root provided, we can choose, im going to let "./" (its going to be "./" from where the program has been executed).
if no "/" at the begining of root, the root provided "merges" with our default one ("./")
if no "/" at the end of root, we automatically add a "/".
if root provided in location, it completely replaces the server one
decided to in path, dont accept "="


for YULIA:
1. Fix CGI so:
You need to test with files containing errors to see if the error handling works properly. You can use a script containing an infinite loop or an error; you are free to do whatever tests you want within the limits of acceptability that remain at your discretion. The group being evaluated should help you with this.
2. Check cgiHandler.cpp code, update if needed?

for TINA:
1. Upload some file to the server and get it back.
2. 

CHUNKS: how to test:
for example

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/feedback \
  -H "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  --data-binary "message=chunked+test" \
  --trace-ascii debug.log

  or with bigger message :)

  url -X POST http://localhost:8080/feedback \
  -H "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  --data-binary "message=chunkedtebkjgbjgbsjfgbjkdbgjdkbgjajhfdfbvjzvbdvbhjdfbgkjsdhbsjdhbgvjhdfbghjdsbgahjdfbkasfjaksfbajksfbhdvbgfdjhfgjkfbst" \ 
  --trace-ascii debug.log
