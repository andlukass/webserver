Tina: You can test our the website response, if you open another terminal and type: curl -i http://localhost:8002/
you should see this if it's okay, or 404,etc... if it's not okay OR you can check browser->devTools->Network, you reload there the page and it'll show you the status number

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1288

COMPARISON nginx with our webserver stept:
1 which nginx - test if installes
2 copy default one to test a site
sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/test_site
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/test_site
3 enable
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/test_site /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

Yulia:
0. What parameters are mandatory in config?
1. (addition to previous) now if there is no location we put default. maybe we can just fail it? 
2. we need to check that no duplicated ip:port - on which side should we do it?
3. ClientMaxBodySize - I think we need to convert it to long or size_t or something? based on letter that we get (m, g, k, b)
4. I think bytes should be allowed in ClientMaxBodySize
5. 

Lucas notes:
if no root provided, we can choose, im going to let "./" (its going to be "./" from where the program has been executed).
if no "/" at the begining of root, the root provided "merges" with our default one ("./")
if no "/" at the end of root, we automatically add a "/".
if root provided in location, it completely replaces the server one
decided to in path, dont accept "="
